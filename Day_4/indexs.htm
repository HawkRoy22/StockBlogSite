                  <p class="article-content">
                    The divergence between the economy and capital markets has only grown since the Coronavirus pandemic. With interest rates on bonds so low stocks seem to be the last place for reasonable growth. Amazon issued $10 billion in debt recently with an interest rate of .4%. When private companies can borrow at the same rate as the Federal Reserve, the debt market really has nowhere to go. As more capital leaves the debt market and makes a home in equities, prices will continue to rise. The rise in stocks is not necessarily rooted in optimism but in the reality of probable returns.

                      </h2>
                      <p class="article-content">
                        The senate unanimously passed this act yesterday. It’s amazing to believe the most polarized poltical body in the United States could agree to something so wholeheartedly. This amendment will have a material impact on the ADS (american depository securities) of foreign companies specifically Chinese companies. The major requirements of the bill are two fold

                        The PCAOB must be able to regulate the company in subject’s auditor
                        The Company must demonstrate that they are not owned by a central government
                        While many companies will be able to adhere to the first stipulation the bill was designed to exclude all Chinese companies from adhering to the second requirement. Considering the only position I currently possess is a Chinese security what does this mean for me.
                        While many companies will be able to adhere to the first stipulation the bill was designed to exclude all Chinese companies from adhering to the second requirement. Considering the only position I currently possess is a Chinese security what does this mean for me.

Firstly, institutional investors will liquidate their equity shares in Chinese companies as a precautionary reaction to this bill. This will inevitably depress the share price of these companies significantly. Secondly, the uncertainty around the passage of this bill will lead to an immediate devaluation by the financial community of any Chinese security and will persist for sometime until the political reality becomes clear. Both of these reactions do not bode well for the short term performance of Chinese companies ADS price and cast doubt on their long term performance.

In reaction to this political escalation by congress I only have one option. Which is to liquidate my recently acquired position for a nominal change in value and be done with this affair. I do not like this option because I firmly believe Jinko Solar is well positioned to capitalize on the World’s transition to renewable energy. Their ability to manufacture high efficiency solar panels at extremely low costs represent a competitive moat that is difficult to overcome. Additionally the company is currently the largest manufacturer of pv-modules and would probably extend this lead over time. I also believe their relatively inexpensive panels represents an ability to strengthen margins over time and become increasingly more profitable over the next five years or so. Also by divesting from the actual solar projects themselves and focusing solely on the production of pv-modules they are focused on doing what they do best. It is an unfortunate political escalation which has both dramatically clouded their long term prospects and led to a real reduction in their market value.

                        Jinko Solar Is a Fantastic Company trading Cheaply
                      </h2>
                      <p class="article-content">
                        Jinko Solar is currently the world’s largest Photovoltaic Module manufacturer. Their current manufacturing capacity of Jinko is roughly 40 GW . This demonstrates tremendous growth from just 8 GW a few years ago. The share price of the company has not reflected this amazing growth in capacity has not been reflected in it’s share price. Additionally, management continues to plan for increasing capacity during the economic downturn. This should demonstrate the resilience of the company. While China, the company’s domestic market, accounts for ~85% of their revenue, the company is expanding into EMEA and America. The potential of these new markets offers tremendous sales and profit growth for the company. A point of concern may be the stated low margin of 3% for the company’s products. However, this margin reflects sales of all the company’s products. Jinko, being a vertically integrated PV-module manufacturer sales many low margin products across it’s value chain. This does not reflect the true margin of close to 18% on the company’s primary offering. Another point of concern may be the heavy debt load of the company. While the debt load is natural for an industrial company of this size, the operating cash flow from the company’s sales is more than enough to cover these debts. The company also said that their customers have not asked for shipment delays during the pandemic.

                      <p class="article-content">
                        The underlying assumption I made when analyzing Spirit was that it’s true value or prospective value had changed marginally in the pandemic.

If he doesn’t see a quick or inevitable return in demand, clearly something has fundamentally changed in the market. Another critical error in my analysis is ignoring Spirit’s high fixed operating costs. Reading a seeking alpha article that used Delta and United Airlines operating cost to measure what the fixed cost for an airline is, made me realize that although Spirt and Southwest are highly capitalized it will not be enough. There is no way they can be agile and maintain enough liquidity given their business models. Additionally with such a dramatic and sustained drop in demand it will be impossible to be agile and profitable. With this high level of uncertainty I believe there is not, currently, a sufficient margin of error for a purchase to be made.

                      <p class="article-content">
                        Spirit Airlines will survive the Coronavirus crisis.  The company has $894 million in cash and has access to a revolving credit facility of $110 million which carries an interest rate of 2% plus the LIBOR and has the option to increase it to $350 million.  Additionally, the company is slated to receive $330 million through the Payroll Protection Program.  This means the company should have around $1.2 billion in liquidity with an option to increase it to $1.4 billion.  The company’s primary expenses are from labor and fuel which combined account for ~50% of operating costs.  The drop in oil prices and reduction in capacity will limit the $1 billion spent on fuel last fiscal year.
